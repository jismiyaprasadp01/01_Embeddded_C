/*
1. Pointer Declaration and Initialization
Goal: Understand how to declare a pointer and store the address of a variable.

Activity:

Declare an integer variable: int a = 5;
Declare a pointer to int: int *ptr;
Assign the address of a to ptr: ptr = &a;
Print both a and *ptr using printf.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a=5,*ptr;
ptr=&a;
printf("%d %d\n",a,*ptr);
}
